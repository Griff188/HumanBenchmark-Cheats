### type racer:

v1 utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) through the tesseract engine. Under the default training package, it returns a string with 65-85% accuracy. Using an updated training data package, [eng.traineddata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata), accuracy can go up. Targeted user training of the engine would be the only way I know of to increase accuracy up towards 100%.

v2 gets the text out of the code of the site, so it will get 100% accuracy every time.
